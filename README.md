# _volume_control_gesture
Volume control using hand gesture recognition is an innovative and touch-free method that allows users to increase or decrease the volume of a device (like a computer or mobile) just by moving their hand in front of a camera. This system uses computer vision and machine learning to detect and interpret hand movements.
